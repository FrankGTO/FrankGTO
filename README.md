- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FrankGTO
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making simple applications for outdoor activities
- ðŸŒ± I've decided to share this app in order to invite contributors improving it while keeping it simple (in terms of scope and energy needs)
- I use TODO markers in the source when improvement ideas come to me, if you wish to contribute to this, you're welcome and I'll be happy to merge your work
